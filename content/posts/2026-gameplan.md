## Core Philosophy

**Foundation**: 0xKyle's strategy is "peak retail investing" with two pillars:
1. **Trend-following** the larger macro bull market
2. **Generating alpha** through asset picking and position sizing

**Key Principle**: Be comfortable with "average or slightly above average" returns rather than swinging for home runs. This allows year-on-year compounding without sacrificing personal time.

**The Jesse Livermore Rule #2 Approach**: Only play during "easy mode" (bull markets), step away during "hard mode" (bear markets). No shorting.

## Part 1: Understanding the Current Market Environment

### The Crypto Reality Check

**Critical Insight**: Crypto is in a secular bear market with intermittent booms (AI Season Jan 2025, ICM Meta May 2025, DATs July-Oct 2025).

**Why Crypto Has Changed**:
- Long-term risk-adjusted returns no longer exist
- Structural disconnects between capital formation and shareholder value
- Assets must be traded around, not held
- 99% of assets will never reach prior ATHs again
- Charts look like "rollercoaster rides" rather than compounding growth

**The Three Fatal Flaws** of most crypto tokens:
1. Egregious tokenomics with massive supply dumping
2. Little to no value accrual to the token
3. No revenue generation

**Action Items**:
- Recognize that crypto opportunities now come in short bursts (1-2 month alt seasons)
- Plan to take profits quickly when opportunities arise
- Don't expect to hold crypto positions long-term

## Part 2: The Pivot to Equities

### Why Equities Now?

**The Retail Revolution**: Retail investors now account for ~20% of US stock market trading volume (Q3 2025), second-highest on record.

**Key Data Points**:
- Early 2025 retail flows rival pandemic peak
- Six-fold increase in 25-year-old investors since 2015
- More democratized access globally

**Markets Becoming "Crypto-Like"**:
- Faster boom-bust cycles
- More narrative-driven price action
- Increased volatility in small/mid-caps

### Your Edge as a Crypto Trader

**Transferable Skills**:
1. **Narrative identification** - Spotting themes before they peak
2. **Volatility tolerance** - Holding through 40% drawdowns
3. **Retail psychology** - Understanding how retail flows move markets
4. **Speed** - Making decisions quickly in fast-moving situations

**Your Weakness to Overcome**:
- **Selling too early** - Crypto taught you "never hold," but quality stocks can compound
- PTSD from LUNA, FTX, etc. makes you exit at first sign of trouble
- Need to unlearn this reflex for long-term equity winners

## Part 3: Building Your Investment Process

### Step 1: Identify Strong Themes

**2025's Winning Themes** (for reference):
- Hyperscalers (IREN, HUT)
- Space (ASTS, RKLB, PL)
- Financialization (HOOD, SOFI)
- Memory (SNDK, SK Hynix)
- Robotics (TER)
- Nuclear (OKLO)
- Quantum (IONQ, QBTS)
- Precious Metals (Silver, Gold)

**How to Find Themes**:
- Use second-order thinking: What will X technology enable? What follows from Y trend?
- Monitor what retail is getting excited about early
- Look for overlooked sectors with strong fundamentals
- AI tools have flattened informational edges—focus on synthesis

### Step 2: Know What Tables to Play At

**Your Ideal Hunting Ground**:
- Small to mid-cap stocks (sub $10 billion market cap)
- Companies with real products/revenue
- Areas overlooked by institutions but discoverable by retail

**Avoid**:
- Trading news or earnings (no edge here)
- Mega-cap tech (too efficient)
- Pure momentum plays without fundamentals

### Step 3: Stock Selection Criteria

Look for companies with:
1. **Growth trajectory** - Expanding QoQ/YoY
2. **Reasonable valuation** - Not priced for perfection
3. **Retail appeal** - Simple story, relatable product
4. **Reasonable float** - Enough liquidity but not overcrowded
5. **Catalyst visibility** - Clear events that could drive re-rating

**Reference Examples**:
- DAVE: 35x since 2023
- RKLB: 12x since Sep 2024

### Step 4: Position Sizing and Risk Management

**Portfolio Construction**:
- Start with smaller positions as you build conviction
- Scale into winners (add to positions showing strength)
- Cut losers quickly (crypto instincts help here)
- Keep some cash for opportunities

**Risk Parameters**:
- No single position should devastate your portfolio
- Be willing to hold through volatility IF fundamentals intact
- Set mental stop-losses but be flexible based on news

## Part 4: The 2026 Specific Gameplan

### Market Positioning

**For Crypto**:
- Stay mostly out or very selective
- Only play obvious short-term narratives (1-2 month windows)
- Hold: High-quality assets with actual value accrual (like HYPE)
- Watch for: AI Video-related on-chain season, gambling tokens

**For Equities**:
- Focus on ex-US markets (likely to outperform)
- Small/mid-cap focus over mega-caps
- Sector rotation: Robotics, metals, nuclear, specific AI applications

### Specific Predictions to Position Around

**High Conviction**:
1. **Gold to $5,000** - Structural bull market in precious metals
2. **Robotics IPOs** - Deeply underrated versus AI hype (e.g., Unitree)
3. **Ex-US outperformance** - Continue 2025 trend
4. **Stablecoin adoption** - CIRCLE above $200

**Medium Conviction**:
5. **BTC bottoms around $70k** - Limited downside, unclear upside
6. **Chinese luxury revival** - Popmart, Laopu Gold
7. **Nuclear energy continues** - Ongoing structural trend
8. **Quantum computing** - Still early narrative

**Crypto-Specific**:
9. **HYPE new ATH** - One of few quality altcoins
10. **Short alt season** - AI Video related, 1-2 months max
11. **More crypto M&A** - Industry consolidation
12. **DATs mostly fail** - Only MSTR, BMNR survive

## Part 5: Execution Framework

### Daily/Weekly Routine

**Information Diet**:
- Monitor Twitter/X for theme emergence
- Read earnings calls for companies you hold
- Track retail sentiment on platforms like WeBull, Robinhood
- Use AI tools to scan for catalysts

**Portfolio Review**:
- Weekly: Review all positions, check if thesis intact
- Monthly: Assess overall theme exposure, rebalance if needed
- Quarterly: Compare performance to benchmarks, adjust strategy

### When to Buy

**Entry Signals**:
- Theme is emerging but not overcrowded
- Stock has pulled back from recent high (better entry)
- Catalyst visible within 3-6 months
- Retail starting to notice but not yet piled in

### When to Sell

**Exit Signals**:
- Thesis breaks (fundamentals deteriorate)
- Extreme euphoria (everyone's talking about it)
- Better opportunity elsewhere (opportunity cost)
- Hit your price target (take profits systematically)

**Scaling Out Strategy**:
- Sell 25% at 2x
- Sell 25% at 3x
- Let rest run with trailing stop
- Always take SOMETHING off at significant gains

## Part 6: Avoiding Common Mistakes

### Don't Do This:

1. **Holding for "conviction" through clear deterioration**
2. **FOMO buying into parabolic moves**
3. **Ignoring position sizing** (going too big too fast)
4. **Trading outside your circle of competence**
5. **Trying to catch every move** (overtrading)
6. **Forgetting to take profits** (being greedy)

### Do This Instead:

1. **Have clear thesis, but be flexible**
2. **Buy on weakness in strong themes**
3. **Size appropriately and scale**
4. **Play at your tables** (small/mid-caps)
5. **Be selective** (quality over quantity)
6. **Systematically de-risk winners**

---

## Part 7: Metrics to Track

### Performance Metrics:
- Absolute return vs. starting capital
- Return vs. relevant benchmarks (S&P 500, NASDAQ, crypto indices)
- Win rate on individual positions
- Average holding period
- Maximum drawdown

### Process Metrics:
- Number of themes identified vs. acted on
- Entry timing quality (buying dips vs. tops)
- Exit timing quality (selling into strength vs. weakness)
- Portfolio concentration/diversification balance

---

## Part 8: Mindset and Philosophy

### Core Beliefs to Internalize:

1. **"Average returns" compound beautifully** - Don't need to be a genius
2. **Knowing when NOT to play is crucial** - Preservation > aggression
3. **Markets cycle** - What works now won't work forever
4. **Adaptability beats stubbornness** - Be willing to change
5. **Your time has value** - Don't sacrifice life for marginal gains

### The Ultimate Goal:

**"If you make life-changing profits on the way, remember - change your life."**

This means:
- Take profits and improve your life circumstances
- Don't just reinvest everything forever
- Use money as a tool for freedom, not scorekeeping
- Know when "enough is enough"
